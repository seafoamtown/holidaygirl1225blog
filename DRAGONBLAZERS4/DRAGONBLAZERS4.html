<p>Okay, so I know that it's only been like half an hour since the trailer came out, and I should PROBABLY wait until we have more information, but I noticed something in the trailer that I just HAVE to talk about!</p>
<p>If you guys remember from Dragon Blazers (the very first one!) there was a huge moment in Chapter 3 where the heroes all find this lost island that you can't normally access unless you do certain steps.</p>
<p>The island itself isn't actually named in-game, but the song that plays on the shore when you're there is called NORTHERNLIGHT, which is a reference to the Isles of Northernlight from Lord of the Hammer! (it's a super famous book which the original game was actually based on! not to brag but the author actually lived in my hometown! no biggie XD)</p>
<p>And you know what the FIRST thing you see in the new trailer is?</p>
<p>The Northern Lights!!!!!?????</p>
<p>WHAT DOES THIS MEANNNNNNN OMG!!! ARE WE GONNA FINALLY GET TO EXPLORE THE ISLAND FOR REAL???? XD</p>
<p>I'm actually gonna be thinking about this for weeks!!!!</p>
<p>We know that the new game has the White Cloak in it too, so maybe we'll finally get answers about her backstory before she ended up sealed in the Glacier?!!?!</p>
<p>There's also a secret code or something near the end of the trailer with some symbols on it??? If anyone can decode it PLEASE <a href='../index.html'>sign my guestbook</a>!!!! I know my blog is only small but pleaseeee it would be so amazing!</p>
<p>Even though Dragon Blazers is super popular, there's like NO good wikis or resources out there! So I really want to make this blog somewhere people can go to if they're stuck or looking for <a href='../lost/whereareyou.html'>secrets</a>!
<p>Anyway that's enough from me again! I have to get back to rewatching the trailer for like the 50th time XD</p>
