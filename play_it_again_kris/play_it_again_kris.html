<p>Kris and Susie came over today. We were supposed to work on our group projects, but that didn't quite to go plan in the end. After I got a call, Kris scurried off, leaving me and Susie alone together.</p>
<p>It was a little bit awkward to start. We just sort of sat in silence. I was just so nervous to be around her, I had no idea what to do or say.</p>
<p>But suddenly... I don't know what changed but, while me and Susie sat side-by-side, we started hearing them play a song in the Kitchen.</p>
<p>I hadn't heard Kris play piano in a long time.</p>
<p>They played for a while, too. Probably at least ten minutes or so.</p>
<p>Susie got really excited. She said that she'd never heard them play before. Not that well, anyway.</p>
<p>Seeing her so happy... It made my worries melt away just a little bit.</p>
<p>The silence between us felt a lot warmer after that, just listening to what they'd play together. We just needed something to ease the atmosphere, I think.</p>
<p>A concert just for us.</p>
<p>I wonder if Kris knew that I was nervous. Maybe they were trying to help, in their own way. I'm not sure they ever knew how much I liked listening to them play, but... it's a nice thought.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>I don't think Susie noticed, but...</p>
<p>I think I cried. Just a little bit.</p>
<p>Softly. Just to myself.</p>
<p>I missed this.</p>
<p>I missed them.</p>
