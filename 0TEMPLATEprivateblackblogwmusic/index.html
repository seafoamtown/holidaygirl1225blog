<p>It's funny... there was a time when they were coming over almost every day.</p>
<p>We'd play, and we'd play... then after a while, they would suddenly get very still, like they were remembering something.</p>
<p>They'd go into the dining room to "get a snack," then after a few moments, I'd hear the piano.</p>
<p>The first few times, I went into watch them play, but when they realized I was looking, they'd always shut the piano and come back.</p>
<p>So over time, I just started staying on the couch in the living room. I'd lie there, listening to them play, sometimes for hours, sometimes even until I fell asleep.</p>
<p>Even then, what were they thinking about me?</p>
<p>Maybe they weren't thinking about me at all.</p>
<p>They didn't have a piano at their house, so they probably just came over to use mine.</p>
<p>Even then, with my eyes open, there were times when I wasn't even sure if we were friends.</p>
<p>But when I closed my eyes,</p>
<p>it felt like a concert just for me.</p>
