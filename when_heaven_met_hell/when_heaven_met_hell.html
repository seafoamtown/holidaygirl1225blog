<p>Some weird stuff happened to me lately, and it got me thinking about stuff again.</p>
<p>Old stuff, mostly. Places, people. But weirdly, the one thing that I've been thinking about more than anything else?</p>
<p>Is Kris.</p>
<p>It feels like we've known eachother forever. Sometimes I think they're the only person that really knows me. Heck, it feels like they know me better than I know me sometimes!! XP</p>
<p>I still remember the day we first met.</p>
<p>Dess woke me up from my nap, practically exploding with excitement that I didn't really understand. She said I had to get up, and that there was a surprise waiting for me at the Dreemurrs' house.</p>
<p>Before I could ask what she was talking about, she had already run off downstairs, so I just got dressed.</p>
<p>It's silly looking back on it, but I ended up putting on my angel wings (the ones from the Holiday Pageant the year before) to feel less nervous before we left. Part of me thought that if the surprise was something scary, I could just fly really far away so it couldn't get me.</p>
<p>The walk from our house to their's was only a short one but we went in the car anyway because of the rain. Mom always haaaated the rain, but I remember Dad just laughing and saying "it's only a little drizzle!!"</p>
<p>Before we got out of the car, Dess turned to me and said "You ready, Elly?"</p>
<p>I think she could tell I was nervous, because she let me stay close by her when we got inside. The light from indoors just looked so warm when the door opened. That familiar cinnamony smell just felt like it was luring me inside lol! It always smelled like something was being freshly baked in their house. It just felt so homely and inviting.</p>
<p>Ms. Toriel looked SO excited when she saw me. She gave me this big smile, bigger than I'd ever seen her smile before. I think it sort of intimidated me XD</p>
<p>It felt like everyone was looking at me when I got into the living room. All the adults had these expectant looks on their faces while I was still just confused.</p>
<p>Then I saw them.</p>
<p>Just beside Asriel, was this other little kid the same age as me. They had a striped shirt, just like Asriel's, and they wore this bright red headband with devil horns on it.</p>
<p>I'd never seen anything like them before. So I hid behind Dess's legs. Not... really sure why I thought that was a good idea? Dess was skinny as heck back then, it was like hiding behind a twig for protection XDDD</p>
<p>Dess kneeled down and gave me a little push towards them, saying "C'mon, they're just a human. You've seen scarier things than them in my room!"</p>
<p>I just remember clinging to her legs, saying I wanted to stay with her instead. Dess just giggled, saying she had some "big kid stuff to talk about with Azzy", or something? Looking back, it's sooo obvious what they were up to, given that when she came back downstairs she was wearing his jacket, but little me had no idea XP I'm pretty sure I remember black lipstick on Azzy's fur, too...</p>
<p>The funniest thing was, before Dess went to "talk" to Asriel, she said "don't worry, Kris won't bite!"</p>
<p>Umm... that's exactly what they did!!!!</p>
<p>Mom was so mad, but I just remember seeing Dad trying not to laugh.</p>
<p>After Ms. Toriel finished putting a bandaid on my finger, Kris came up to me and held my hand, shaking their head. They didn't say a word, but looking back, I think they were trying to apologise? Either way, definitely not the best first impression X)</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, I don't think they meant to hurt me. I think they were just trying to show affection, in their weird Krismas-y way.</p>
<p>After we got over that, though, we ended up becoming friends pretty fast. They'd say something every now and then, but they always were really quiet back then. I think that was sort of nice though? We never really needed to talk much to have fun. Even if it was a bit hard to know what was going on in their head sometimes.</p>
<p>They're just so different now. Definitely more talkative, anyway. Sometimes it feels like I'm talking to a completely different person, just with Kris's face X) Susie seems to think that the new Kris is normal, though, so maybe it's just me.</p>
<p>We've both changed a lot since back then. Growing up does weird stuff like that. Sometimes I wish we could go back to the way things were.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll try to talk to them soon. They seem to get along with Susie a lot. Not so much Gabi, though...</p>
<p>It would be nice to <a href='../play_it_again_kris/play_it_again_kris.html'>reconnect</a> after everything that's happened... Then maybe one day,</p>
<p>we'll be able to pick up back where we left off.</p>
